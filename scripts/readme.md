### Getting Test Ontologies

You need [wget](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wget)
and [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.html) installed for this script.

Run:

```
sh scripts/robot.sh
```

from the repository root.
If successful you should find small ontology files in `tests/assets/ontologies`
