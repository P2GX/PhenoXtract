At present many parts of the model are exploratory and set to undergo refactoring.  In addition, many classes and properties have GENO URIs but are place holders for classes that will be imported from an external ontology (e.g. SO, ChEBI, OBI, etc).  Furthermore, ongoing work will implement a model of genotype-to-phenotype associations. This will support description of asserted and inferred relationships between a genotypes, phenotypes, and environments, and the evidence/provenance behind these associations. \n\nDocumentation is under development as well, and for now a slidedeck is available at http://www.slideshare.net/mhb120/brush-icbo-2013"

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)"

By using role terms in definitions, we can create a BFO conformant treatment of such entities drawing on the fact that, while an instance of professor may be simultaneously an instance of trade union member, no instance of the type professor role is also (at any time) an instance of the type trade union member role (any more than any instance of the type color is at any time an instance of the type length).If an ontology of employment positions should be defined in terms of roles following the above pattern, this enables the ontology to do justice to the fact that individuals instantiate the corresponding universals –  professor, sergeant, nurse – only during certain phases in their lives."

By contrast, the concept of a 'gene allele' here is positionally defined - representing the sequence present at the location a gene resides in a reference genome (based on sequence alignment).  An Shh gene allele, for example, may be a fully functional wild-type version of the gene, a non-functional version carrying a deleterious point mutation, a truncated version of the gene, or even a complete deletion. In all these cases, an 'Shh gene allele' exists at the position where the canonical gene resides in the reference genome - even if the extent of this allele different than the wild-type, or even zero in the case of the complete deletion.\n\nA genomic feature being an allele_of a gene is based on its location in a host genome - not on its sequence. This means, for example, that the insertion of the human SMN2 gene into the genome of a mouse (see http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3056903) DOES NOT represent an allele_of the human SMN2 gene according to the GENO model - because it is located in a mouse genome, not a human one.  Rather, this is a transgenic insertion that derives_sequence_from the human SMN2 gene.  If this human SMN2 gene is inserted within the mouse SMN2 gene locus (e.g. used to replace mouse SMN2 gene), the feature it creates is an allele_of the mouse SMN2 gene (one that happens to match the sequence of the human ortholog of the gene).

According to current SO criteria defining genes, a 'gene' no longer exists in the case of a non-functional or deleted variant.

Even for completely deleted genes, an allele of the gene exists (and here is equivalent to the junction corresponding to the where gene would live based on a reference alignment).\n\nThis design allows us to classify genes and any variants of those genes (be they functional or not) as the same type of thing (ie a 'gene allele'), since classification is based on genomic position rather than functional capacity. This is practical for representation of variant genotypes which often carry non-functional versions  of a gene at a particular locus.

Here, \"genetic context\" refers to the allelic state of the variant, which depends on what other alleles exist at the same location/locus in the genome. Zygosities such as heterozygous and homozygous are simple, common examples of 'states' of an allele. \n\nThese genetic and environmental \"interactions\" of alleles play out at the level of the gene products produced by the causal alleles, and are observable in the pattern with which the trait caused by an allele is inherited across generations of individuals. Thus, an inheritance pattern such as dominance is not inherent to a single allele or its phenotype, but rather a result of the relationship between two alleles of a gene and the phenotype that results in a given environment. This also means that the 'dominance' of an allele is context dependent - Allele 1 can be dominant over Allele 2 in the context of Phenotype X, but recessive to Allele 3 in the context of Phenotype Y." ],

The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). \n\n3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome." ],

This complement is typically a pair of two features in a diploid genome (with two copies of each chromosome). E.g. a gene pair, a QTL pair, a nucleotide pair for a SNP, or a pair of entire chromosomes.\n\nThe fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets  feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. apart from sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.

        "comments" : [ "1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype \"fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]\", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to \"propagate phenotypes\" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data." ],

This is valid ontologically because we commit only to sequence features being GDCs - which allows for their concretization in either biological or informational patterns. Accordingly, a particular gene allele, such as shh<tbx292>, can be part of a genome in a biological sense and part of a genotype in an informational sense. This idea underpins the 'genotype partonomy' at the core of the GENO model that decomposes a complete genotype into its more fundamental parts, including alleles and allele complements, as described in the comment above."

We model them as 'complements' because they include all known/relevant alleles within a defined region in the genome (e.g. a 'gene', or a 'haplotype block') - where this set may consist of 0, 1, or more alterations from some reference.  Because they are genetically linked, the alleles comprising a haplotype are likely to be co-inherited and survive descent across many generations of reproduction. \n\nAs highlighted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype, the term 'haplotype' is most commonly used to describe the following scenarios of genetic linkage between 'alleles':\n\n1. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' (SNPs) or other small alterations, which  collectively tend to occur together on a chromosomal strand). This use of 'haplotype' is commonly seen in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, to describe a state where two or more alterations that are believed to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \n\n2. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are SNPs or other short alterations, which collectively define a specific version of a gene. In this case, the locaiton bounding the haplotype corresponds to a gene locus, and the haplotype defines a specific allele of that gene (i.e 'gene allele'). \"Star alleles\" of PGx genes are examples of this category of haplotype (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ipd/imgt/hla/get_allele_hgvs.cgi?A*33:01:01, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724253/).\n\n3. Each of the 'alleles' comprising the haplotype is itself a 'gene allele' (i.e. a specific version of an entire gene), such that the haolotype contains multiple complete 'gene alleles' that are co-inherited because they reside in tightly linked clusters on a single chromosome.   \n\nEach of these more specific definition serves a purpose for a particular type of genetic analysis or use case. The GENO definition of 'haplotype' is broadly inclusive of these and any other scenarios where distinct 'alleles' of any kind on the same chromosomal strand are genetically linked, and thus tend to be co-inherited across successive generations." ],

Dosage increases if there is a duplication of the gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This sets it apart from the notion of 'copy number', which reflects how many actual copies of a sequence exist in a genome. Addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its dosage.\n\nDuplications of a sequence can occur at new locations in the genome, such that the resulting sequence represents a distinct sequence feature from the copy at its native locus.  For example, duplication of a region containing the human APOE gene on a different chromosome creates a sequence feature that shares sequence from the original gene, but not location, and therefore represents a different sequence feature.  The notions of dosage and copy number are therefore concerned with sequence-level entities (how many copies of a 'sequence' exist), as opposed to sequence feature-level entities.  The notion of a single-locus complement would be used to describe how many of a particular features are present in a genome - and describe which alleles of this feature are found." ],

In GENO, we say that a genomic location is occupied_by a 'sequence feature' - where the identity of this feature depends on both it sequence, and its location in the genome (i.e. the locus it occupies).  For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations. \n\t\n2. A given genomic location (e.g. the human SHH gene locus) may be occupied by different alleles (e.g. different alleles of the SHH gene). Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.\n\n3. The notion of a genomic location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be occupied_by physical objects, while a genomic location is occupied_by sequence features. Just as a spatiotemporal region is distinct from an object that occupies it, so too a genomic locus is distinct from a sequence feature that occupies it.  As a more concrete example, consider the distinction between a street address and the building that occupies it as analogous to the relationship between a genomic location and the feature that resides there." ],

The relationship between 'haplotype' and 'haplotype block' is analogous to the relationship between 'gene allele' and 'gene':  a 'gene allele' is one of many possible instances of a 'gene', while a 'haplotype' is one of many possible instances of a 'haplotype block'.  In this sense, a gene allele can be considered to be a haplotype whose extent is that of a gene (as it is generally true that there is a low probability of recombination within any given gene).\n\n2. Haplotypes typically contain more than one 'genetically-linked' loci where sequence alterations are known to exist, such that a set of alterations will be co-inherited together across many generations of reproduction.  A common use of 'haplotype' is in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, where this term refers to sequence containing two or more alterations that are beleived to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \n\nGENO's definition is consistent with but more inclusive than this view, allowing for haplotypes with one or zero established alterations as long as there is a low probability of recombination within the region it spans (such that alterations found in cis are likely to remain in cis across successive generations). As a result, GENO considers any allele that spans an extent greater than that of a single sequence alteration to be a haplotype - as long as there is an expectation of low recombination frequency within the haplotype block occupied by the allele. For example, a 'gene allele' is a haplotype representing a particular version of a gene that contains one or more sequence alterations - as a 'gene' is a region of sequence with a low probability of recombination that is generally expeted to be inherited as a unit. \n\n3. As highlighted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype, the term 'haplotype' is most commonly used to describe the following scenarios of genetic linkage between 'alleles':\n\na. The first is regions containing multiple linked 'gene alleles' - i.e. specific versions of entire genes that are co-inherited because they reside in tightly linked clusters on a single chromosome.  \nb. The second is a region containing multiple linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tend to occur together on a chromosomal strand (i.e. be statistically associated).  This use of 'haplotype' is commonly seen in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, to describe a state where two or more alterations that are believed to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \nc. A third, which is related to the previous case, occurs when the extent of region containing linked SNPs is that of a single gene.  In this case, the haplotype represents a 'gene allele' - a version of an entire gene defined by the set of sequence alterations it contains.

We want to be able to represent two 'variants' of the shha gene in this scenario as separate 'qualified sequence feature' instances so we can capture data about the phenotypes resulting from each - just as we would separately represent to different sequence variants (alleles) of the shha gene at the sequence feature level so that we can track their associated phenotypes." ],

A gene allele that varies by only one nucleotide from the wild-type gene may not qualify if that alteration eliminates the function of the allele.  This represents an important distinction between 'copy number' and 'functional copy number'. The former is not concerned with the functionality of sequence copies - only that there is a duplication of sequence in the genome. Thus, the addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its 'functional copy number (aka its dosage).", "The notion of 'functional copy number' (aka 'genetic dosage') describes how many 'functional' copies of a sequence are present in a genome - i.e. sequences that retain their normal activity and/or produce gene products that retain their normal activity.  In diploid organisms, the normal dosage is 2 for autosomal genes/regions. Dosage increases if there is a duplication of the gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This latter condition sets it apart from the notion of a 'copy number complement', which reflects how many actual copies of a sequence exist in a genome.

In diploid organisms, the normal copy number for sequences at most locations is 2 (a notable exception being those on the X-chromosome where normal copy number is 1). Variations in copy number occur if this count increases due to a duplication of the gene/region, or decreases due to a deletion of a gene/region. A driving use case for representing copy number is to support associations between variation in copy number of a particular sequence, and phenotypes or diseases that can result.\n\nA 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a set may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as 'copy number complements' representing the set of all copies of a particular sequence in a genome. \n\nThe fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome here, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement' apart from feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.  But the 'single locus complement' at the APOE gene locus would still have a count of two - because the duplicated copy is at a different location in the genome, and therefore does not represent a copy of the APOE locus.", "The notion of a 'complement' is useful as a special case of a set, where the members necessarily comprise an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Here, a 'copy number complement' represents 'represents the set of *all* copies of a specified sequence in a particular genome.

In reality the sequence of each copy may not be identical, given the tendency of large regions to accumulate subtle variations. What matters is that they share a common origin/alignment with a defining location in a reference genome.\n\nWe represent the notion of copy number at the \"sequence level\" (as opposed to the \"sequence feature level\")  because we are concerned only with the number of copies of a sequence in a genome, and not the location of the features bearing this sequence. Consider a copy number complement comprised of three copies of the sequence defined by the location Chr8 100000-200000 on a GRCh38.2 reference genome.  In one person's genome, this sequence may appear at its normal location on Chromosome 8, as well as in duplications on chromosomes 5, and 12. In another genome the sequence might appear three times as well, but on chromosomes 8, 9, and 15.  When representing causal associations linking copy number to disease, it is important that these are considered to be *the same* copy number complement - because what a curator associates with a disease is the presence of three copies of some sequence in a genome, independent of their location. The \"sequence level\" representation here supports this use case.  By contrast, a \"feature level\" representation, where identity of a copy number complement would be based on the identity of member *features*), does not - because we have two sets comprised of entirely different features (based on location being tied to their identity)."

The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as the set of all functional copies of a particular sequence in a genome. This is known as the 'functional copy number' or 'genetic dosage' of the sequence.\n\n'Functional copies' of a sequence are those that exhibit normal activity and/or produce gene products that exhibit normal activity associated with the sequence. The count of functional copies of a gene is often referred to as its 'dosage'. In diploid organisms, the normal 'dosage' is 2 for autosomal genes/regions. Dosage increases if there is a duplication of a functional gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This sets it apart from the notion of a 'copy number complement', which reflects how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of their functionality. Addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its dosage.\n\nAs we saw for 'copy number complement', the defining sequence here is specified in terms of a location on a reference sequence - typically the location where a gene or set of genes resides.

        "comments" : [ "(copied from ReO)\nReagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.\n\nReagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance will realize only one of these roles in the execution of a given assay or technique. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.\n\nIn regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique, note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique)." ],

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now."

Historically, many texts consider the first passage as the clearest point to define the beginning of a line. However, in practice it is more often that case that more than one passage, and possibly additional selective techniques, may be required before a culture is deemed to have sufficient stability and homogeneity to be considered cell line. This is the view taken in OBI. Regardless, what is important is that some intentional, experimental step has been taken to establish a more homogenous and stable culture that can be characterized and  progatated over time."

        "comments" : [ "(copied from ReO)\nReagents are distinguished from devices/instruments that also serve as facilitators in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, devices do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.\n\nReagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.\n\nIn regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique:  note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique)." ],

The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."

Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene is the same 'sequence' as the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene, but these represent two distinct 'sequence features' in virtue of their different positions in the genome." ],

This third criteria is extrinsic to its sequence and its genomic location.

        "comments" : [ "On the relationship between 'transgenic insertions', 'transgenes', and 'alleles'\nTransgenic insertions are sequence alterations comprised of foreign/exogenous sequence. This sequence can be from the same or different species  as the host cell or genome - it is exogenous in virtue of it being additional sequence inserted into the original host genome. A given transgenic insertion may create one or more transgenes when introduced into a host genome. The extent of a transgene is spans all features needed to drive its expression in the host genome.  In most cases a transgenic insertion completely contains one or more transgenes that are fully competent to drive expression in the host genome.  But in some cases, a transgenic insertion may carry only part of the final transgene it creates - which requires additional endogenous sequences in the vicinity of its insertion site to complete a functional gene (e.g. this is the case for enhancer traps or gene  traps) to complete.\n\nIn addition to the transgenes they create upon genomic integration, transgenic insertions can create variant alleles by disrupting a known endogenous gene/locus. Variant alleles are versions of a particular genomic features (typically genes), that are altered in their sequence relative to some reference.  An insertion that disrupts an endogenous gene would be considered a 'sequence alteration' (sensu SO) which creates a 'variant gene allele'. From the perspective of this disrupted gene, the origin or transgenic nature of this insertion is irrelevant - what matters here is that the gene's sequence has been altered to create an allele.  \n\nFor the purposes of modeling, any transgene(s) created when an endogenous gene is interrupted by an insertion is considered/modeled separately from the allele of the endogenous gene that is created by the insertion.  The transgenic insertion, which is simply a sequence alteration in the host genome, is then linked to any transgenes that it contributes to or overlaps with or contains.  The model of the Flybase example HERE illustrates this approach.", "Transgenes can exist as integrated into the host genome, or extra-chromosomally on replicons or transiently carried/expressed vectors.  What matters is that they are active in the context of a foreign biological system (typically a cell or organism).\n\nNote that transgenes as defined here are not necessarily from a different taxon than that of the host genome.  For example, a Mus musculus gene over-expressed from a chromosomally-integrated expression construct in a Mus musculus genome qualifies as a transgene because it is exogenous to the host genome." ]

A 'sequence alteration' is an allele whose sequence deviates in its entirety from that of other features found at the same genomic location (i.e. it deviates along its entire extent). In this sense, 'sequence alterations' represent the minimal extent an allele can take - i.e. that which is variable with some other feature along its entire sequence). An example is a SNP or insertion. \n\nAlleles whose extent goes beyond the specific sequence that is known to be variable are not sequence alterations. These are alleles that represent alternate versions of some larger, named feature. The classic example here is a 'gene allele', which spans the extent of an entire gene, and contains one or more sequence alterations (regions known to vary) as part.\n\n2. Sequence alterations are not necessarily 'variant' in the sense defined in GENO (i.e. being 'variant with' some reference sequence).  In any comparison of alleles at a particular location, the choice of a 'reference' is context-dependent - as comparisons in other contexts might consider a different allele to be the reference. So while sequence alterations are usually considered 'variant' in the context in which they are considered, this variant status may not hold at all times. For this reason, the 'sequence alteration' class is not made an rdfs:subClassOf 'variant allele'. \n\nFor a particular instance of a sequence alteration, howver, we may in some cases be able to rdf:type it as a 'varaint allele' and a 'sequence alteration', in situations where we can be confident that the feature will *never* be considered a reference. For example, experimentally generated mutations in model organism genes that are created expressly to vary from an established reference.\n\n3.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other."

        "comments" : [ "To allow users to make important distinctions in discourse and modeling, GENO clearly separates the notions/levels of 'biological sequence', 'sequence feature', and 'sequence location' ('genomic locus' when found in a genome). This sets up an important terminological nuance when it comes to alleles, where we believe it correct to say that a particular genomic feature is an alleles_of some genomic locus (as opposed to an allele_of some sequence or some feature). This is typically a gene locus, but even insertions falling outside of genes are considered alleles_of the locus they alter (e.g. alleles of other types of named loci such as QTLs, or alleles of some unnamed locus of arbitrary size).\n\nWhile conceptually it is most correct to say features are alleles_of some genomic locus, it is common practice to say that they are alleles of the class of feature defined to reside at that locus (typically a gene).  Accordingly, we may write things like \"fgf8a<ti282a> is an allele of the Danio rerio fgf8a gene\", and we may create data where fgf8a<ti282a> is asserted as an allele_of  the fgf8a gene class IRI. But here we mean more precisely that it is an allele of the locus at which the fgf8a gene resides.  Allowing for this means that we dont have to create 'feature-based location/locus' terms mirroing all feature class terms already in exiistence (e.g. for every gene).\n\nIt is important to be clear that the location/locus that a feature is an allele_of is defined exclusively by its genomic position, and not on the sequence it may contains. This is particularly relevant when considering transgenic insertions. For example, this means that the insertion of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence within the D. melanogaster Bx gene locus would create an allele of the D. melanogaster Bx gene, but not an allele of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene. The transgene that results from such an insertion, while expressing S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence, is not an allele of this gene because it does not reside at the S. cerevisiae GAL4 locus. \n\nThis departs from how some databases use the term 'allele' - where transgenes expressing an exogenous gene are considered to be alleles of the exogenous genes they carry.  For example, in the example above, Flybase describes the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene as an allele_of the  S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene (and gives it the allele identifier FBal0040476). A GENO representation on the other hand would say that the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene derives_sequence_from the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene, but is not an allele_of this gene. In a GENO model, FBal0040476 would be typed as a transgene insertion, but not considered an allele_of the Scer\\GAL4 gene.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just semantics, but worth clarifying given the ubiquity and variable use of the term 'allele'. The GENO model attempts to define and adhere to the principled notion of positionally-defined 'alleles', and functionally-defined 'transgenes'." ],

Propagation 'down' a genotype (from larger components to smaller ones)\n2. Propagation 'up' a genotype (from smaller components to larger ones)\n3. From sex-qualified genotypes down to the sex-agnostic genotype and its components (but not 'up' to a sex-qualified genotype).\n4. From an effective genotype to its intrinsic and extrinsic components.\n5. From genotype components to genes (note here that a separate chain is needed to propagate conditions asserted on a sequence alteration to the gene, because of the fact that the link to the gene is from the variant locus/allele).\n6. (Exploratory). There are cases where we may also want inter-genotype propagation (i.e. propagation that extends beyond moving up or down a single genotype). For example, if a phenotype is asserted on a sex-qualified intrinsic genotype, we want it to infer down through its component sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype and then up to any effective genotypes of which this sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype is a part. Given the data in hand, however, the conditions for this will likely never occur, so probably ok not to implement a chain to support this.\n\nNote that we do not want to propagate phenotypes up from sex-agnostic genotyeps to sex-qualified ones (e.g.from shha<tbx392>/shha<tbx392> [AB] to shha<tbx392>/shha<tbx392> [AB](male)) - because it may not be the case that a phenotype assessed without consideratioon to sex will apply on a sex-specific background.  So we would not create a property chain to propagate inferred condition associations from sex-agnaostic intrinsic genotypes and their parts to sex-qualified intrinsic genotypes and effective genotypes that contain them (such as:  has_variant_part o has_sex_agnostic_part o has_variant_part o 'causes condition')"

          "val" : "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types."
